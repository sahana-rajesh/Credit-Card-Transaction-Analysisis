## Project Overview

SQL-based analysis of 107K credit card transactions (2019–2021) to uncover spending behavior, detect fraud patterns, and generate actionable recommendations for marketing and risk teams. Demonstrates a range of SQL techniques including aggregations, window functions, CTEs, and JOINs.

**Key business questions answered:**
- Which categories and states drive the most revenue?
- Which categories are fraud hotspots?
- When is fraud most likely to occur?
- What does a fraudulent transaction look like vs a legitimate one?
- Which U.S. regions carry the highest fraud risk?
- Which months had unusual fraud spikes?

## Business Recommendations

**Fraud Prevention**
- Online categories (`shopping_net` 1.54%, `misc_net` 1.50%) are the highest fraud risk — apply stricter 2FA verification
- Transactions between **10pm–2am** are 5x more likely to be fraudulent — trigger automatic verification during these hours
- Fraudulent transactions average **8x higher spend** ($544 vs $67) — flag any transaction above $500 in high-risk categories for manual review
- December consistently shows the highest fraud activity — increase monitoring and review team capacity in Q4

**Marketing Strategy**
- **TX, NY, PA** are the top 3 revenue states — prioritize marketing budget and merchant partnerships here
- **Grocery and shopping** categories drive the most revenue — prime candidates for cashback offers and loyalty rewards
- Peak transaction volume occurs between **12pm–9pm** — optimal window for push notifications and promotional campaigns
- June, October, and December are seasonal spending peaks — align campaigns with these months

**Regional Risk Strategy**
- Regions with above-average fraud rates need stricter real-time monitoring rules and localized fraud alert campaigns
- High revenue, low fraud regions are ideal targets for premium card feature rollouts and loyalty program expansion

## SQL Techniques Demonstrated

- Aggregations — `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`
- Filtering — `WHERE`, `HAVING`
- Grouping & sorting — `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Window functions — `SUM() OVER()`
- Date functions — `HOUR()`, `DATE_FORMAT()`, `YEAR()`, `DATE_ADD()`
- Conditional logic — `CASE WHEN`
- CTEs — `WITH` clause for multi-step logic
- JOINs — `JOIN` with a lookup table for regional mapping
- Set operations — `UNION ALL`
